#Ccrypt

This project is a GUI based E2E encryption email service in java/javascript. This project is largely based off of PGP, but with a few modifications to make it more usable. Also with inspiration from riot.im. 

This project was inspired by a course I took at OSU called Usable security(CS 419). My research in that course was on the usability of E2E encryption chat services (Whatsapp, Riot, and PGP). I really enjoyed it and wanted to create my own E2E encryption chat service and base it off of PGP.
